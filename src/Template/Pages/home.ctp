            Like the very first Muncie MusicFest back in 2007, last night's festival was accompanied by an unexpected
            downpour of rain. And just like that first night, Munsonians came out despite the weather, showed their
            support, and were rewarded with a fantastic time. On behalf of the 130 musicians, 45 staff members, dozen
            organizations, and six
            venues who created the tenth annual Muncie MusicFest, thank you for your attendance, your support, your
            kind words, and the part you play in this beautiful community.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm going to steal some of my own words from last year on this subject, because it's as true today as it
            was then: It would take all day to list everybody who deserves credit and explain how awesome they were at
            their jobs, big or small, but suffice it to say that Muncie MusicFest 2016 was a giant demonstration that
            grassroots, independent volunteer efforts can create great things and truly grow our community. I hope that
            this year's success will inspire people to contribute some of their time and energy to helping their local
            arts and entertainment scene by volunteering to help run upcoming events, by supporting existing community
            projects, or by creating brand new ways to make the world a little bit better, easier, more connected, more
            beautiful, and more full of music.

            Our lineup features rock, metal, indie, country, americana, blues, folk, electronic, and hip-hop, and even
            ventures out into such diverse musical territories as chamber-folk, jungle, chiptune, and psychobilly.
            We have new, up-and-coming bands as well as established Muncie favorites. We have touring bands that have
            made an impact on the Muncie music community in the past. You'll find music to bring your grandparents to
            see and music that will give children nightmares. You'll find stages where you'll be invited to sit and
            relax, and you'll find energetic dancefloors to join.

            The band application deadline has ended, and we're now hard at work getting confirmations from bands
            so we can announce an official lineup. <strong>90 bands have applied to perform</strong> and we only have
            room to book 40 to 50 of them, so we're putting a lot of effort into getting a good, representative mix of
            both well-known and up-and-coming bands, bands from Muncie and out-of-town bands that have a following in
            Muncie, bands for the younger crowd and older folks, and bands from every major genre. Sadly, we can't book
            all of the bands that we want to (and saying no to half of the applicants is heartbreaking), but we have a
            preliminary lineup that we think everyone will really enjoy, which includes rock, metal, indie, country,
            americana, blues, folk, electronic, and hip-hop.
        </p>
        <p>
            So hang tight, and expect announcements about this year's lineup soon.
