<p>
    Samples of your music help us get to know you, match you with similar artists, and introduce website
    visitors to your music. Before uploading any songs, carefully read the following.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Submit <strong>up to <?= $songsLimit ?></strong> tracks.
    </li>
    <li>
        Submit only <strong>original music</strong> that you have full distribution rights to.
        This typically does not include cover songs.
    </li>
    <li>
        Submit <strong>mp3-formatted</strong> music.
    </li>
    <li>
        Apply a <strong>"Song Title.mp3"</strong> format to each song's filename before uploading it.
        Please remove track numbers from the filenames so we don't think they're part of a song's title.
    </li>
    <li>
        Bonus points if you
        <strong>
            fill out the file's
            <a title="ID3" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id3">ID3</a>
            information
        </strong>
        with your band's name, the song's title, and any other information that you can.
        <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+edit+id3+tags">How to edit ID3 tags</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
        By submitting music tracks, you unconditionally <strong>agree to allow their redistribution</strong>
        through the festival website, festival compilation CDs, and radio promotion for
        the festival in perpetuity.
    </li>

        just click the checkbox under 'Delete' and submit this form to delete that track.
        Then you'll be able to upload a new one to replace it.
