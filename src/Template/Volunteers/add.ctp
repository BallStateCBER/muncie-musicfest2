    Thank you for your interest in helping put on Muncie MusicFest, but we've reached our volunteer signup deadline
    for the year. Check back in 2017 for information about how to get involved in the next festival!

            We need a bunch of people to help us put on Muncie MusicFest this year, mostly at the daytime half of the
            festival that will take place at <a href="http://cornerstonearts.org/">Cornerstone Center for the Arts</a>.
            Want to be one of them? Just sign up here, and we'll be in touch about how you can help out.
        </p>

        <p>
            And remember that volunteering is more fun with friends! Be sure to encourage a few pals to sign up too.
